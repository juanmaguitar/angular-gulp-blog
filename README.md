# Angular Blog w/ Gulp tasks "modularized"

This project is based on the one explained on the book [Desarrollo Web Agil con Angular.js](https://carlosazaustre.es/blog/ebook-angular/) written by [Carlos Azaustre](https://carlosazaustre.es/blog/)

I've modularized and updated the gulp tasks and done some improvements on the angular code

This project can serve as a boilerplate for an angular project managed by gulp
